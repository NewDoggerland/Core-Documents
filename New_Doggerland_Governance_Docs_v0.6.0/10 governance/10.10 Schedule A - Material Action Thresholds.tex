\section{Status and Authority}

\noindent
\textbf{Status:} Binding governance schedule \\
\textbf{Authority:} Adopted by the Governing Body pursuant to the Consolidated Governance Document v0.6.1 \\
\textbf{Hierarchy:} Subordinate to the Consolidated Governance Document; superior to Operational Manuals

This Schedule defines concrete thresholds and classifications that operationalize the definition of \emph{Material Action} in the Consolidated Governance Document. Where thresholds are met or exceeded, the action is conclusively material and must follow all Material Action requirements.

Mutability: Unchangeable

\section{General Rule}

An action is a \textbf{Material Action} if it meets or exceeds any threshold in this Schedule, regardless of intent, reversibility, or duration.

Failure to meet a threshold does not guarantee that an action is non-material; judgment must still be applied using the definition in the Consolidated Governance Document.

Mutability: Unchangeable

\section{Financial Commitments and Spending}

\subsection{Single Expenditure Thresholds}

Any single commitment, expenditure, reimbursement, or obligation meeting or exceeding the following thresholds is a Material Action:

\begin{itemize}
\item \$2,500 for equipment, tools, furnishings, or supplies
\item \$1,000 for professional services, consulting, or advisory services
\item \$500 for travel, lodging, or discretionary expenses per individual per event
\end{itemize}

Mutability: Unchangeable

\subsection{Aggregate Spending Thresholds}

Multiple related expenditures must be aggregated when they are part of the same project, purpose, vendor relationship, or temporal window.

An aggregated commitment meeting or exceeding:
\begin{itemize}
\item \$5,000 within any rolling 30-day period, or
\item \$10,000 within any rolling 12-month period
\end{itemize}
constitutes a Material Action.

Mutability: Unchangeable

\subsection{Contracts and Ongoing Obligations}

Any contract, lease, service agreement, or subscription that:
\begin{itemize}
\item exceeds six (6) months in duration, or
\item creates automatic renewal, or
\item cannot be terminated without penalty
\end{itemize}
is a Material Action regardless of dollar value.

Mutability: Unchangeable

\section{Personnel and Compensation}

The following actions are Material Actions:

\begin{itemize}
\item creation or elimination of a paid role
\item any compensation adjustment exceeding ten percent (10\%) annually
\item provision of housing, stipends, or non-cash benefits outside standard payroll
\item any compensation or benefit involving the Founder or a related party
\end{itemize}

Mutability: Unchangeable

\section{Assets and Land}

Any action involving:
\begin{itemize}
\item acquisition, sale, lease, or encumbrance of land
\item acquisition or disposal of assets valued above \$5,000
\item granting of easements, access rights, or long-term use rights
\end{itemize}
is a Material Action.

Mutability: Unchangeable

\section{Delegation and Authority}

The following constitute Material Actions:

\begin{itemize}
\item creation, modification, or revocation of delegated approval authority
\item granting bank access, signing authority, or system administrator rights
\item creation of any role with independent spending or contracting authority
\end{itemize}

Mutability: Unchangeable

\section{Emergency and Exception Use}

Invocation of:
\begin{itemize}
\item Emergency Authority
\item Continuity Authority
\item Foundational Phase interim handling methods
\end{itemize}
is conclusively a Material Action.

Mutability: Unchangeable

\section{Interaction With Operational Manuals}

Operational Manuals must:
\begin{itemize}
\item reference this Schedule explicitly where spending or approval limits appear,
\item prohibit circumvention by splitting or sequencing actions,
\item default to Material Action routing where uncertainty exists.
\end{itemize}

Mutability: Unchangeable
