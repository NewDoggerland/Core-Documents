\section*{Purpose of this appendix}

This appendix provides a \textbf{menu of common grant pathways} that align with
New Doggerland’s governance, operational constraints, and audit framework.

It is intended to help Donor-Advised Funds and donors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item translate donor intent into enforceable restrictions,
    \item select low-risk funding pathways, and
    \item understand the oversight and reporting associated with each grant type.
\end{itemize}

This appendix does not create permissions or authority.
All grants remain subject to governing thresholds, approval requirements, and logging rules.

\section*{How to use this menu}

Each grant type below includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Intended use}
    \item \textbf{Explicit exclusions}
    \item \textbf{Oversight and review characteristics}
\end{itemize}

DAFs may adopt these categories directly or use them as templates
when drafting restricted-grant language.
